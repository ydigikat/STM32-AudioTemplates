# CMake
I'm not going to go into how CMake works, there are plenty of online resources and books that cover that.

I will just elaborate on what is in the CMakeLists.txt files to assist in navigating them.

### Top-Level CMakeLists.txt

The top-level CMakeLists.txt file contains the top-level build information.  This is largely obvious but there are some options in here that can be turned on if you want them.

The file specifies the minimum version of CMake required (3.20 at the time of writing).


``` option(FLASH_BUILD,"Flash binary after build" OFF) ```

This option will automatically flash the device after a build.  This is OFF by default.

The file directs CMake to look for further information in the source folder.

### Source folder CMakeLists.txt
This file contains more significant information on how to build the project.  

- It defines the output executable and the source files that are needed to build it.
- The location of include files
- Compiler options and definitions
- Linker options and definitions

It also includes a pseudo target to do the FLASH_BUILD that can be optionally enabled from the top-level CMakeLists.txt file.

This is a relatively simple CMakeLists.txt file and adding to it should be straightforward.
